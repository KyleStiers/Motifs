# Motifs
A repo containing all relevant Markdown, code, and assets used in posts for the [substack Motifs](https://kylestiers.substack.com/).

Each post will go in its own directory (see [posts](/posts/)).

Until I figure out a better way to get the Markdown to Substack seamlessly - the preview on GitHub might be a better reading experience.

More to come!
